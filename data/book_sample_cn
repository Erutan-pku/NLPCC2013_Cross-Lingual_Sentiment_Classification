Involving a very wide range of content to my sort of shock: quantum physics, cosmology, human psychology and spiritual world, biology, anthropology, religion, Buddhist meditation (many people are like \"apple taste\" I am also), Maya civilization and so on. It is difficult to imagine but reasonable, the author is not any of the above areas of the industry. But it is for this reason, although the book is full of dense turn of the professional scientific content, but it is clear, logical clear, quite tension and shock effect. This is one of the very nice reasons for it.\n　　\nSpeaking of this, can not help but praise a completely by virtue of their own spirit of exploration, in addition to working life, you can also understand such a wealth of professional knowledge and high-end science; actually can use 4 years (class or drop, but almost all Of the rest time) through a variety of contacts, and mental patients, mental disorders and other strange people close contact with the strange people. The author said that sometimes contact with a mental patient may have to contact more than 10 times, only an effective communication. When they are in the state of the disease, dialogue or other forms of communication are too difficult and almost impossible to get any real communication. But when they are sick, how the degree, but completely uncontrollable. Only once to visit, until the accumulation of enough information and dialogue recording, know the beginning and end of this case. I reflect on myself, still studying psychology graduate courses, also known as fascinated, but never so action, and even try to deepen the case of the idea did not give birth; but very Chinese-style, passive listening class only. Really mother drops is high and now legislation.\n　　\nIn addition, although reading this book so that we \"normal\" know that strange crowd (and our different \"patient\") in the end is how kind of thinking, how kind of behavior (in fact, can do this already Not easy), but the author did not flow in the \"Secret\" \"broke the news\" of the city talk about the words, the word line can also be seen between the open human feelings. Well, I would like to talk about this view: the real respect for the truth, the courage to explore the unknown, in essence, are probably open, pure, and has a great kindness. Great kindness and great wisdom and homology, so I sometimes looked at the author and the group of crazy and eccentric dialogue, but also a little bit of tears to the posture. I think it is better than the metaphysical enlightenment of my specific high-end technology, which is the best place in this book.\n　　\nI sometimes think that if someone has a adolescent rebellious child, just think of handsome imagination of the opposite sex, hate learning and discipline; it should be bought to let him read this book, no one preaching, but he will be these mental patients Pondering the knowledge of shock, and began to like to learn (at least physical!).",
